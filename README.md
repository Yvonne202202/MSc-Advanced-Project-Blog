# MSc Advanced Project Blog - Clock of Life

## Project Brief
I once had a discussion the topic of death with my friends. Most of us feel some kind of fear when talk about death. This stems not only from the fear of the end of one's own life, but also from the pain of losing those close to them. Death often carries a heavy burden on people, so many people choose to avoid this sensitive topic, which also makes them feel helpless when they actually face death.

Therefore, I am planning to make an interactive installation around the theme of "life and death", which will incorporate some physics experiments. I hope viewers will come to a different understanding and thinking about death through this interactive installation.

### Research
Human's concept of life and death varies due to cultural, religious and other reasons.  Therefore, I think I need to understand people's views on death from a different perspective before I start the project.

People's perceptions of death are often influenced by their religious beliefs. Those with higher levels of religious belief had lower levels of death anxiety. They accept death in a more neutral way. In contrast, people with no religious affiliation were more likely to have death anxiety and positive attitudes about extending life.

In addition, the degree of death anxiety is also related to different regional cultures.

There are some taboos about death in East Asian cultures. For example, people sometimes avoid talking about death, especially on celebratory occasions. In addition, for traditional East Asians, especially Chinese, the same pronunciation as "death" is considered unlucky. For example, the word for the number "4" and "clock" in Chinese is pronounced the same as "death", so people should not give clocks or watches as gifts, and should also avoid giving things with a number of 4. Although many younger generations of East Asians are more open to these traditional taboos, the influence of such traditional thinking persists.


There are different attitudes towards death, even if there are certain differences among people from different cultural backgrounds, there are still some common points.
In every culture people mourn the dead. In a sense, people respect death, which is also a respect for life.

The famous philosopher Nietzsche once proposed "eternal reincarnation". He believed that the lives of dead individuals would reappear countless times in infinite time. The famous ancient Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu believed that death is another form of life, not the end of life, but the beginning of life.

I think I could use installation art to explain the relationship between life and death from a philosophical point of view.
