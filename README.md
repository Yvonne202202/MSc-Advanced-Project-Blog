# MSc Advanced Project Blog - Clock of Life

## Project Brief
I once had a discussion the topic of death with my friends. Most of us feel some kind of fear when talk about death. This stems not only from the fear of the end of one's own life, but also from the pain of losing those close to them. Death often carries a heavy burden on people, so many people choose to avoid this sensitive topic, which also makes them feel helpless when they actually face death.

Therefore, I am planning to make an interactive installation around the theme of "life and death", which will incorporate some physics experiments. I hope viewers will come to a different understanding and thinking about death through this interactive installation.

## Ideation
### Research
Human's concept of life and death varies due to cultural, religious and other reasons.  Therefore, I think I need to understand people's views on death from a different perspective before I start the project.

People's perceptions of death are often influenced by their religious beliefs. Those with higher levels of religious belief had lower levels of death anxiety. They accept death in a more neutral way. In contrast, people with no religious affiliation were more likely to have death anxiety and positive attitudes about extending life.

In addition, the degree of death anxiety is also related to different regional cultures.
