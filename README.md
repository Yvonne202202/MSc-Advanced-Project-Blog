## Project brief
In this project, I combined OpenFrameworks and Arduino to control the image and sound through an ultrasonic sensor. In the part of sound, I used ofxMaxim library and combined the sound and signal processing techniques learned last semester. For the visual part, I generate two balls using class inheritance.
